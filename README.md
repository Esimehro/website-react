<!-- List five significant features of React -->
1. ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, and each component has its own logic and controls. These components can be reusable which help you to maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.

2. ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple to code as well as understand.Since ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need. This makes it simple to use and learn.

3. React contains a lightweight representation of real DOM in the memory called Virtual DOM. Manipulating real DOM is much slower compared to Virtual DOM as nothing gets drawn on the screen.

4. React supports various extensions for application architecture. It supports server-side rendering, Flux, and Redux extensively in web app development. 

5. Testing React apps is easy due to large community support. Even Facebook provides a small browser extension that makes React debugging easier and faster.

<!-- List five major advantages of React -->
1. Makes JavaScript coding easier

2.  It enables fast and quality assured application development that in turn saves tIme for both - clients and developers.

3. Excellent cross-platform support.

4. Handles dependencies.

5. It has dedicated tools for easy debugging.

<!-- What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React? -->
- Jordan Walke
- Facebook

<!-- What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
 -->
1. Self-closing tags in JSX must have the forward slash whereas the forward slash is optional in the HTML self-closing tags.

2. In JSX we use className attribute whereas in HTML we use the class attribute. This is because JSX is transpiled into JavaScript and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

3. Event listeners in JSX are written in camelCase, for instance, onClick whereas in HTML, they are written in lowercase for instance, onclick.

<!-- Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX? -->
Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
